        <div class="section">
            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            
            <h3>How does the app calculate yearly cost?</h3>
            <p>
                The app converts all subscriptions to yearly amounts:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Monthly subscriptions: Price × 12</li>
                <li>Yearly subscriptions: Price as is</li>
                <li>Weekly subscriptions: Price × 52</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What is "Yet to pay"?</h3>
            <p>
                "Yet to pay" shows the total amount of subscriptions that have a payment due in the current month. This helps you see how much you need to pay this month.
            </p>

            <h3>Is my data stored online?</h3>
            <p>
                No. All your data is stored locally on your device. Nothing is transmitted to external servers. Your data is only shared with the widget extension on your device.
            </p>

            <h3>Can I export my data?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes! Triple-tap the total amount at the top of the screen to export all your subscription data as a CSV file. You can then share it or open it in spreadsheet apps.
            </p>

            <h3>How do I track EMIs?</h3>
            <p>
                When adding a new subscription, select "EMI" as the payment type. Enter the total EMI duration (e.g., 12 months) and update the "Completed EMIs" count as you make payments. The app will show you how many EMIs remain and the total amount left to pay.
            </p>

            <h3>What happens if I delete the app?</h3>
            <p>
                All your data will be deleted from your device. Make sure to export your data before deleting if you want to keep a backup.
            </p>

            <h3>Why don't I see the widget?</h3>
            <p>
                Make sure you've added at least one subscription. The widget needs data to display. Also, ensure you've granted the necessary permissions when adding the widget to your home screen.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
            
            <h3>App crashes or freezes</h3>
            <p>
                Try closing and reopening the app. If the problem persists, restart your device. As a last resort, you can delete and reinstall the app (note: this will delete all your data unless you export it first).
            </p>

            <h3>Data not saving</h3>
            <p>
                Make sure you tap the save button after entering subscription details. If data still doesn't save, try restarting the app or your device.
            </p>

            <h3>Widget not updating</h3>
            <p>
                Widgets may take a few moments to update. Try removing and re-adding the widget to your home screen. Make sure the app has the necessary permissions.
            </p>

            <h3>Export not working</h3>
            <p>
                Make sure you have at least one subscription added. Triple-tap the total amount (not just tap once). If it still doesn't work, try restarting the app.
            </p>

            <h3>Can't edit or delete subscriptions</h3>
            <p>
                Make sure you've expanded the card first by tapping on it. The edit and delete buttons appear at the bottom of the expanded card view.
