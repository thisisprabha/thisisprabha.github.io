        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>
            Leave Planner helps you find the best opportunities to maximize your time off by combining holidays with minimal leave days.
        </p>
        
        <h2>How to Use</h2>
        <h3>Importing Your Holidays</h3>
        <p>You can import your holiday calendar in three ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scan Calendar:</strong> Use your camera to scan your calendar. The app will automatically extract holiday dates.</li>
            <li><strong>Upload Screenshot:</strong> Upload a screenshot of your calendar. The app will process it to find holidays.</li>
            <li><strong>Import CSV:</strong> Import a CSV file with your holidays. The file should have columns for date and holiday name.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Viewing Leave Opportunities</h3>
        <p>
            Once your holidays are imported, the app automatically calculates the best leave opportunities. You'll see:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>How many days off you'll get</li>
            <li>How many leave days you need to take</li>
            <li>A calendar view showing the dates</li>
            <li>A detailed breakdown of each day</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Settings</h3>
        <p>
            Customize your leave preferences:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Preferred Leave Day:</strong> Choose Friday, Monday, or both to optimize your leave strategy.</li>
            <li><strong>Reset Data:</strong> Clear all your data and start fresh if needed.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        
        <h3>How does the app calculate leave opportunities?</h3>
        <p>
            The app analyzes your holidays and finds opportunities where you can combine weekends and holidays with minimal leave days to get maximum time off.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Is my data stored online?</h3>
        <p>
            No. All your data is stored locally on your device. Nothing is transmitted to external servers.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Can I export my data?</h3>
        <p>
            Currently, the app focuses on importing holiday data. All calculations and opportunities are displayed within the app.
        </p>
        
        <h3>What if the CSV import doesn't work?</h3>
        <p>
            Make sure your CSV file has a "DATE" column and a "DESCRIPTION" column. The date format should be readable (e.g., "1-Jan-2026" or "01/01/2026").
        </p>
        
        <h3>Why aren't my leave opportunities showing?</h3>
        <p>
            Make sure you've imported holidays for the current year. The app shows opportunities for the next 6 months from today. Check the Calendar tab to see all opportunities throughout the year.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
        
        <h3>App crashes or freezes</h3>
        <p>
            Try resetting the app data from Settings. If the problem persists, delete and reinstall the app.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Calendar scan not working</h3>
        <p>
            Make sure you've granted camera permissions. Ensure the calendar image is clear and well-lit. Try using the screenshot upload option instead.
        </p>
        
        <h3>CSV import errors</h3>
        <p>
            Check that your CSV file has proper headers (DATE and DESCRIPTION columns). Ensure dates are in a readable format. Remove any special characters or formatting issues.
        </p>
