    <h1>Privacy Policy for That's My Font</h1>
    <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 7, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>That's My Font ("we," "our," or "us") operates the That's My Font mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our App.</p>
    <p>By using the That's My Font App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>Information Automatically Collected</h3>
    <p><strong>We do NOT collect any personal information or user data. The App operates entirely on your device.</strong></p>

    <h3>Information Stored Locally on Your Device</h3>
    <p>The App stores the following information locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Drawn Characters:</strong> Your hand-drawn characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and optional characters) stored as drawing data</li>
        <li><strong>Character Adjustments:</strong> Position, scale, and alignment settings for each character</li>
        <li><strong>App Preferences:</strong> Drawing tool settings (pen/pencil, brush width, smoothness toggle)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information is stored locally on your device and is <strong>never transmitted</strong> to our servers or any third parties.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>The locally stored information is used solely to:</p>

        <li>Export TTF font files via iOS Share sheet</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>

        <li>All character drawings and preferences are stored locally on your iPad</li>
        <li>No data is transmitted over the internet</li>
        <li>No data is stored on external servers</li>
        <li>Your font data remains under your control on your device</li>

        <li>We do not have access to exported font files</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
