    <h1>Privacy Policy for Days counter</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: December 06, 2025</strong></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Prabhakaran ("we," "our," or "us") provides the <strong>Days counter</strong> app, a time tracking utility
        designed to help you visualize your yearly progress and count down to important events. The app is provided at
        no cost and is intended for use as is.
    </p>
    <p>
        This policy informs you regarding our collection, use, and disclosure of personal information when you use our
        Service.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>We respect your privacy.</strong> Days counter does not collect, store, or transmit any personally
        identifiable information to external servers.
    </p>

    <h3>Local Data Storage</h3>
    <p>
        All the data you enter into the app—including your custom events (names and dates), display preferences, and
        settings—is stored locally on your device using Apple's secure <code>UserDefaults</code> and App Group
        technologies.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> This local storage allows the app and its widgets to function seamlessly and
            remember your preferences.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> This data never leaves your device (except when you perform a standard iCloud
            backup of your device). We do not have access to your events or personal schedule.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Log Data</h2>
    <p>
        In the case of an error in the app, we may collect anonymous data and information (through standard Apple crash
        reporting tools) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device model,
        operating system version, and the time of the crash. This is used solely to fix bugs and improve app stability.
    </p>

    <h2>Service Providers</h2>
    <p>
        The app does not use any third-party services that collect information used to identify you.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Days counter is a general utility app safe for all ages. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable
        information from children. Since all data is stored locally on the device, parents can be assured that their
        child's usage data remains private.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any
        changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
