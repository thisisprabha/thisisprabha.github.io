    <h1>Privacy Policy for Sip Up!</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: December 06, 2025</strong></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Prabhakaran ("we," "our," or "us") provides the <strong>Sip Up!</strong> app, a gamified water tracking
        application designed to help you build a healthy hydration habit through a virtual aquarium experience. The app
        is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.
    </p>
    <p>
        This policy informs you regarding our collection, use, and disclosure of personal information when you use our
        Service.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Sip Up! is designed with your privacy in mind.</strong> We minimize the data we collect.
    </p>

    <h3>Health Data (Apple HealthKit)</h3>
    <p>
        To provide you with comprehensive hydration tracking, Sip Up! may request access to read and write water intake
        data to Apple Health (HealthKit).
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>How we use it:</strong> We use this data solely to display your hydration progress within the app
            and to update your Apple Health records when you log water in Sip Up!.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> This data remains on your device and in your secure iCloud Health store. We do not
            transmit your health data to any external servers or third parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Local Data Storage</h3>
    <p>
        Your game progress (aquarium status, fish unlocked, coins, etc.) and app settings (reminders, preferences) are
        stored locally on your device using Apple's secure storage technologies (UserDefaults and CoreData). This
        ensures your aquarium is available even when offline.
    </p>

    <h2>Log Data</h2>
    <p>
        In the unlikely event of an app crash, we may collect anonymous Log Data through standard operating system
        reporting tools. This may include your device model, OS version, and the time of the crash, solely for the
        purpose of fixing bugs and improving stability.
    </p>

    <h2>Notifications</h2>
    <p>
        Sip Up! uses local notifications to send you hydration reminders ("Time to sip!" or "Save your fish!"). These
        notifications are scheduled locally on your device. We do not use remote push servers to track your notification
        habits.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Sip Up! is safe for all ages. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children.
        Since all data is stored locally, parents can be assured that their child's usage data remains private on their
        device.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any
        changes.
    </p>
