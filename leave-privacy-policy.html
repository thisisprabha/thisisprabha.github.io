        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Leave Planner ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our mobile application.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            Leave Planner is designed with privacy in mind. We collect and store the following information locally on your device:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Holiday Data:</strong> Holiday dates, names, and types that you import into the app through CSV files, calendar screenshots, or manual entry.</li>
            <li><strong>Leave Preferences:</strong> Your preferred leave day settings (Friday, Monday, or both) that you configure in the app settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Year Selection:</strong> The year you're planning for, which defaults to the current year.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>
            All data you enter in Leave Planner is stored locally on your device using Apple's UserDefaults. This data is:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stored only on your device</li>
            <li>Never transmitted to external servers</li>
            <li>Never shared with third parties</li>
            <li>Accessible only to you</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Data Processing</h2>
        <p>
            Leave Planner processes your holiday data locally on your device to calculate leave opportunities. All calculations and analysis happen entirely on your device - no data is sent to any external service for processing.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Data Import</h2>
        <p>
            You can import holiday data into Leave Planner through:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CSV Import:</strong> Upload CSV files containing holiday information. The file is read locally on your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Calendar Screenshot:</strong> Upload screenshots of your calendar. Image processing using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) happens locally on your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Camera Scan:</strong> Take photos of your calendar. Image processing happens locally on your device.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            All image processing is performed locally using on-device OCR capabilities. Images are not uploaded to any external service.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
            We do not collect, transmit, or share your data with any third parties. Your data remains on your device at all times.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            Leave Planner does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. We do not integrate with any external data collection services. All processing happens locally on your device.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Permissions</h2>
        <p>
            Leave Planner may request the following permissions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Camera Access:</strong> Used only to scan your calendar for holiday dates. Images are processed locally and never stored or transmitted.</li>
            <li><strong>Photo Library Access:</strong> Used only to import calendar screenshots. Images are processed locally and never stored or transmitted.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These permissions are optional - you can use the app with CSV import only if you prefer not to grant camera or photo library access.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
        <p>
            You can delete all your data at any time through the app's "Reset All Data" option in Settings. When you delete the app from your device, all associated data is removed.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Leave Planner is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <p>

        </p>
        
        <h2>Your Consent</h2>
