        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Whaypay ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our mobile application.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            Whaypay is designed with privacy in mind. We collect and store the following information locally on your device:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Subscription and Payment Data:</strong> Information about your subscriptions, EMIs, payment amounts, billing cycles, and payment dates that you manually enter into the app.</li>
            <li><strong>User Name:</strong> The name you choose to display in the app (defaults to "My" if not set).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>
            All data you enter in Whaypay is stored locally on your device using Apple's UserDefaults and App Groups. This data is:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stored only on your device</li>
            <li>Never transmitted to external servers</li>
            <li>Never shared with third parties</li>
            <li>Accessible only to you and the app's widget extension</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
            We do not collect, transmit, or share your data with any third parties. Your data remains on your device at all times. The only exception is:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Widget Extension:</strong> Your subscription data is shared with the Whaypay widget extension through Apple's App Groups feature, allowing the widget to display your information. This sharing occurs entirely on your device.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Data Export</h2>
        <p>
            You can export your subscription data as a CSV file using the app's export feature. This export is performed locally on your device, and you choose where to share the exported file.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

            You can delete individual subscriptions or all data at any time through the app. When you delete the app from your device, all associated data is removed.
        </p>
