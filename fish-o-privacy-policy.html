    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: November 25, 2025</p>

    <p>Fish-o Hydrate ("we," "our," or "us") operates Fish-o Hydrate for iOS and Apple Watch (the "App"). This Privacy
        Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our App.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection &amp; Usage</h2>
    <p>We do not collect any personal information or analytics data. The app operates entirely on your device.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The app stores your water intake records and goals locally on your device. No usage data or personal
            information is sent to any server.</li>
        <li>If you grant permission, the app will use Apple HealthKit to read and write water intake information. This
            data remains within your Apple HealthKit account and is not shared externally.</li>
        <li>All hydration records, goals, and settings are securely stored on your device and, if enabled, within your
            private iCloud or HealthKit environment for Apple Health sync.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Apple HealthKit</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The App only accesses HealthKit with your explicit consent.</li>
        <li>No HealthKit data is ever transmitted to us, shared externally, or used for advertising or analytics.</li>
        <li>HealthKit permissions can be managed at any time from your device settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>HealthKit:</strong> Used to read and write water intake data (if you grant access).</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> Used only to remind you to drink water at your chosen interval. No
            notification content leaves your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone, including children. The App is
        suitable for all ages, as it does not collect any personal data.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All data is stored securely on your device using standard Apple security practices.</li>
        <li>Your data is never transmitted to any server or shared with any third party.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy. Changes will be posted on this page and are effective immediately. Please
        review this policy periodically for updates.</p>
